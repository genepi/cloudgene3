# Datasets

Datasets allow you to link applications to each other. Linking two applications enables access to one application's properties from within the other.

In this tutorial, we will create an application that provides different datasets. The user can select one of these datasets and receive some information about it. This example can be used as a template for your own applications.

## Dataset Analyzer

We have a Cloudgene application with the following folder structure:

```ansi
dataset-analyzer
├── cloudgene.yaml
├── analyze-dataset.groovy
├── datasets
|   ├── dataset1.csv
|   └── dataset2.csv
└── README.md
```

In folder `datasets` we have different datasets and the user can select one of these datasets. For this propose, we create the following `cloudgene.yaml` file that contains one input parameter of type `list`:

```yaml
name: dataset-analyzer
version: 1.0
workflow:
  steps:
    - name: Analyze Dataset
      type: groovy
      script: analyze-dataset.groovy
  inputs:
    - id: dataset
      description: Dataset
      type: list
      values:
        dataset1: Dataset 1
        dataset2: Dataset 2
```

To simulate our analysis pipeline, we create a small groovy script called `analyze-dataset.groovy` that prints the content of the selected dataset:

```groovy
import genepi.hadoop.common.WorkflowContext

def run(WorkflowContext context) {

  def dataset = context.get("dataset");
  def directory = context.getWorkingDirectory();

  def content = '';
  switch(dataset){
    case 'dataset1':
      content = new File(directory + '/datasets/dataset1.csv').text;
      break;
    case 'dataset2':
      content = new File(directory + '/datasets/dataset2.csv').text;
      break;
  }

  // annalyze dataset. for demonstration: print content.
  context.ok(content);

  return true;
}
```

Next, we can install our application via the commandline and start a Cloudgene server:

```bash
cloudgene install dataset-analyzer dataset-analyzer/cloudgene.yaml
cloudgene server
```

If we open `http://localhost:8082` in our broswer we can submit a new job for this application:

Depending on the selected dataset, we get different outputs:

The Cloudgene application works as expected. However, the following implementation has several shortcomings:

- each time we want to add a new dataset, we have to adapt the groovy script and have to change `values` in `cloudgene.yaml`.
- this leads to different `cloudgene.yaml` files for different setups on different servers
- different `cloudgene.yaml`files are hard to deploy, update and to manage (especially in full automated Cloud deployments)

## Switch to AppLinks

A more generic solution is to create one application for each dataset. This enables us to separate our application logic from our datasets.
By using AppLinks we have the possibility to link them together and the `cloudgene.yaml` file of our application stays the same no matters how many new datasets we want to create.

### Dataset Application

In a first step, we create an application for Dataset1 with the following folder structure:

```ansi
dataset1
├── cloudgene.yaml
├── dataset1.csv
└── README.md
```

Next, we create the following `cloudgene.yaml` file for our dataset:

```yaml
name: Dataset 1
version: 1.0
category: datasets
properties:
  filename: ${local_app_folder}/dataset1.csv
```

Our `cloudgene.yaml` file contains no workflow steps, instead we define `properties`. This properties can be used to share information from the *Dataset* application to the *Dataset Analyzer* application. In this case we define a property that contains the filename of our dataset. Moreover, we use the `local_app_folder` variable to get the correct directory and to avoid hard-coded paths.

The `category` property can be used to annotate our different *Dataset* applications. We give all datasets the same category so we can further filter them when we create an AppLinks list.

Finally, we can create an application for Dataset2 in the same way.

### Dataset Analzer Application

Now, we can remove all datasets from *Dataset-Analyzer* application:

```ansi
dataset-analyzer
├── cloudgene.yaml
├── analyze-dataset.groovy
└── README.md
```

In the `cloudgene.yaml` file we replace the input type with `app_list` and add a custom filter to display only applications that fall in category `datasets`:

```yaml
name: dataset-analyzer
version: 1.0
workflow:
  steps:
    - name: Analyze Dataset
      type: groovy
      script: analyze-dataset.groovy
  inputs:
    - id: dataset
      description: Dataset
      type: app_list
      category: datasets
```

We adapt our groovy script to read the file from the location we shared through properties. With `context.getData(param_id)` we get access to all properties of the selected application:

```groovy
import genepi.hadoop.common.WorkflowContext

def run(WorkflowContext context) {

  def datasetProperties = context.getData("dataset");
  def filename = datasetProperties.get('filename');
  def content = new File(filename).text;


  // annalyze dataset. for demonstration: print content.
  context.ok(content);

  return true;
}
```

We stop Cloudgene and restart it. When we try to submit a new job, we see that the list of datasets is empty.

Therefore, we stop Cloudgene again and install dataset1:

```yaml
cloudgene install dataset1 dataset1/cloudgene.yaml
cloudgene server
```


Now, when we open the submit dialog of *Dataset-Analyzer*, we see Dataset1 and when we start the job we get the expected output.

## Advantages

- we don't need to change our application when we want to add a new dataset
- we have a simple and straightforward way to create new datasets
- its very easy to share datasets and to install them (independently from the application)
- admin has full control of permissions: access to specific datasets can be managed by user groups
